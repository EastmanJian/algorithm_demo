     * to the tree (mark it as known) and store the weight (as Dist) and the path. And so on...
     * At any point in the algorithm, a new vertex to add to the tree by choosing the edge (u, v) such that the cost
     * of (u, v) is the smallest among all edges where u is in the tree and v is not.
     * The algorithm is essentially identical to Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, exception that the definition of Dist and the
     * update rule are different.
