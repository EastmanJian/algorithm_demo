     * Start from vertex s, mark it as known, find all its adjacent vertices, update the edge weight (as Dist) and the
     * path, find the smallest weight edge and the related adjacent vertex, mark as known, add that vertex to the tree,
     * find that vertex's adjacent vertices from the unknown vertices, update the weight (as Dist) and path if the
     * weight is smaller than the original Dist, also update the path. And so on...
     * At any point in the algorithm, a new vertex to add to the tree by choosing the edge (u, v) such that the cost
     * of (u, v) is the smallest among all edges where u is in the tree and v is not.
     * The algorithm is essentially identical to Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, exception that the definition of Dist and the
     * update rule are different.
